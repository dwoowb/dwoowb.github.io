              <li>
                Worked on the administration product which acted as the hub for a suite of 10+ products. Led this suite of product teams to joint solutions that minimized duplicative work while maximizing reusable components and processes. These teams consisted of both home grown products and those Autodesk had acquired and were spread across multiple timezones and countries. These products were of varied maturity.
              </li>
              <li>
                Guided my team through a significant acquisition/reorganization. Identified the difficulties in transitioning from office-first to remote work early on. Suggested and used applications like gather.town to best recreate an in-person meeting environment.

            </ul>
